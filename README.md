#Online Neural Network-based Language Identification
This repo is WIP copy of my Master's Thesis at the Institute for Anthropomatics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at the "Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition" Research Group.

It includes an approach to identify languages based on Bottleneck Features of each frame produced from a normal Automatic Speech Recognizer trained on 10 languages.

Training was completed using a 5 Hidden Layer 1000x1000 Neural Network with input as the 966-Feature Vector from the ASR neural net.
